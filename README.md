Description
-----------
VDJMut is a commandline tool that takes DNA sequence alignments in fastapair format and outputs a csv file of mutation statistics.

Installation
----
To use this application you will need [Java 1.7 or later](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html).
You will also need [maven](https://maven.apache.org) to build the application.

* Clone the repository using git.

```
git clone https://github.com/khalemano/VDJMut.git
```

* Call maven to build the application.

```
cd VDJMut
mvn package
```

* A jar-with-dependencies.jar file will appear in the VDJMut/target/ directory

Usage
----
The jar is executed with the following options.

	java -jar VDJMut-jar-with-dependencies.jar [-c] [-h] -i <arg> -o <arg> [-t <arg>]
	 -c,--collapse             Process only distinct sequences
	 -h,--help                 Usage information
	 -i,--input-files <arg>    Fastapair files to process
	 -o,--output-files <arg>   Names of outputfiles
	 -t,--threshold <arg>      Process sequences that occur above threshold
 
The command can be given a list of input files to process as long as it is given the same number of output files to write to.
A threshold can be set where only sequences with those counts or higher are processed.
The collapsed flag will cause the algorithm to count unique sequences only once.

Fastapair input files 
---------------
Fastapair files are generated by the [USEARCH](http://www.drive5.com/usearch/) commandline tool.
The program also requires the number of times each sequence should be counted.
